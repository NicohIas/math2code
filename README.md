<h2>
  Information
</h2>

Math2Code is a project of mine, since I can't find anymore things to add (to Jarad), this program will convert your Math and/or Algebra into Binary, then to Gray Code (closest I can get to readable code).

<h2>
  Installation
</h2>

Install by doing the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/NicohIas/math2code
```

<h2>
  How to use
</h2>

Open your IDE and/or CLI and run the Python File, you will be prompted with this:

```Enter your key here```

Enter one of the following keys:

```
1f45e
```
```
45e41
```
```
hh84r
```

After that you will get all the normal and/or usual prompts.

<h2>
  Config
</h2>

There is a file with the name ```config.json``` with some configs you can change to ease your experience with my program.

It includes:

```
{
    "encryptSetting": "True",
    "bypassKeySetting": "False",
    "bypassTagSetting": "False"
}
```

By changing one or more of these settings per-say:

```bypassKeySetting``` and set it to ```True``` we now bypass needing to enter a key.

The rest is pretty self-explanatory
